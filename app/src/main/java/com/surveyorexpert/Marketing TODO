With my marketing cap on, these are the steps I would suggest:

-          Finalise software development on Android and Apple platforms
			
			Refine prototype
				Off line capability
				Version control unique identifier
			Test for suitability
			
			Web
			
				Create CMS for configuration
				Create Website for browsing
				Pre-identified reports
				Configuarable reports
			

-          Test software and iron out any issues
-          Think of brand/business name – you mentioned Silver Lining (more memorable than BMMS) – check availability (URL, limited company..)
-          Articulate benefits of the software for 3 target markets:

o   Private landlords 

o   Large property owners (such as Housing Associations…)

o   BIM compliant organisations

-          Define pricing strategy for each target market

o   Software licence

o   Cloud space

-          Build website, including software demo if possible
- 		   Tutorial and video
-          Identify and prioritise routes to market/agree budget


Finalising the software is clearly critical. 
Let me know when this is done and we can perhaps discuss the project again. 
We can help with any aspect of marketing – I have attached an introduction to The Rooster.
